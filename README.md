# SwissEphNet

This project is an Astrodienst Swiss Ephemeris (http://www.astro.com/swisseph/) .Net portage from 
C (version 2.00.00) to C# in a PCL project for cross platform usage.

# Projects splitted (2014-06-06)

From now the SweNet et SwephNet projects are moved to a new repos [SwephNet](https://github.com/ygrenier/SwephNet).

SwephNet is the next version of SwissEph, with a better .Net implementation. The two projects will 
continue to exist in parallel :
- SwissEphNet : is the direct C to C# portage of the Swiss Ephemeris.
- SwephNet : is the full .Net implementation of the Swiss Ephemeris.

# Usage

Now SwissEphNet is available as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SwissEphNet): `Install-Package SwissEphNet`

Or you can download the binaries in [the last release](https://github.com/ygrenier/SwissEphNet/releases/latest).

SwissEphNet is a Portable Class Library with support for .Net 4+, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8, Windows Store apps, Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS.

## Create an instance

SwissEphNet.SwissEph is ```IDisposable``` so you can use it with an ```using``` statement.

```C#
using (var sweph = new SwissEphNet.SwissEph()) {
    // Use it
}
```

## Loading files

SwissEphNet is a Portable Classe Library and we don't have file access.

As Swiss Ephemeris use some data files, an event exists for loading the files required.

```C#
using (var sweph = new SwissEphNet.SwissEph()) {
    sweph.OnLoadFile += (s, e) => {
        // Loading file
    };
    // Use it
}
```

# Firsts steps

Our first step is to convert the C source code to C#, and provide some conversions from C like string format.

## (x)printf 

We implements (x)printf base methods with the Richard Prinz project (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19274/A-printf-implementation-in-C) with somes updates.

## (x)scanf

We implements (x)scanf base methods with the Jonathan Wood project (http://www.blackbeltcoder.com/Articles/strings/a-sscanf-replacement-for-net) with some updates and unit tests.

## C conversion

All C files are included in the partial class 'SwissEph' each in a specific file.

All exported constants are defined as public in the class.

All exported methods are defined as public in the class.

The other elements are declared as private.

The compilation configuration use pre-processor constants. We remove lot of them in our case. The other are converted as constants, not pre-processor.

# Seconds steps

Now the portage is correct, so we create a new project (https://github.com/ygrenier/SwephNet) with
a new interface more adapted to the .Net guidelines.
